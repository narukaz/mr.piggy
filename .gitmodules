## üê∑ About The Project

**Mr. Piggy** is designed to be a fun and engaging entry point into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). The core vision is to **onboard new users to Web3** by using a concept everyone understands: the piggy bank.

Instead of a ceramic pig, each user gets their own **digital Piggy as a unique NFT**. Users can then save cryptocurrency inside their NFT, set savings goals, and watch their balance grow. This simple act teaches fundamental blockchain concepts‚Äîlike the difference between Non-Fungible Tokens (the Piggy) and Fungible Tokens (the savings inside)‚Äîin an intuitive way.

Compared to a traditional piggy bank, Mr. Piggy offers several key advantages:
-   **Earn Bonuses:** Piggies can earn bonus returns upon reaching a savings goal.
-   **Upgradable Tiers:** Different tiers of Piggies (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.) offer better "health" and higher bonuses.
-   **Gamified Competition:** Users can enter their Piggies into community "Races" to compete for a prize pool, turning saving into a social and rewarding experience.
